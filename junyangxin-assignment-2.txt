   2) Suggested constraint: Distinguish between transitive and intransitive verbs. This can be achived by adding rules to the grammar to enforce that transitive verbs can subcategorize for an NP or a non-finite VP, while intransitive verbs can only subcategorize for a non-finite VP or a PP. In the example provided, 'features' is a transitive verb, and 'live' when considered a verb is an intransitive verb, and what follows 'live' is a noun 'music', thus the ambiguity can be resolved by this constraint.

      Chart Parser - sentence:1, np:3

3. Modified grammar:
   sentence := threeSgNp v | nonThreeSgNp vs | X1 | X2;
   X1 := threeSgNp v threeSgNp | threeSgNp v nonThreeSgNp ;
   X2 := nonThreeSgNp vs threeSgNp | nonThreeSgNp vs nonThreeSgNp ;
   threeSgNp := n | art n | adj n | art adj n;
   nonThreeSgNp := ns | art ns | adj ns | art adj ns;

   And the dictionary file has the content below:
   /************Separating Line**************/
    my,,    cat = art;
    the,,   cat = art;
    old,,   cat = adj;
    young,, cat = adj;
    cat,,   cat = n;
    cats,,  cat = ns; 
    mouse,, cat = n;
    mice,,  cat = ns; 
    chase,, cat = vs; 
    chases,,  cat = v;
    with,,  cat = p;
    relish,,  cat = n;
    play,,  cat = vs; 
    plays,, cat = v;
    football,, cat = n;
    footballs,, cat = ns; 
    fair,, cat = n;
    fair,, cat = adj;
    answers,, cat = v;
    answer,, cat = vs; 
    answers,, cat = ns; 
    answer,, cat = n;
    questions,, cat = ns; 
    question,, cat = n;
    questions,, cat = v;
    question,, cat = vs; 
    lives,, cat = v;
    live,, cat = vs; 
    live,, cat = adj;
    music,, cat = n;
    features,, cat = v;
    feature,, cat = vs; 
    features,, cat = ns; 
    feature,, cat = n;
   /************Separating Line**************/

   Using this new grammer and dictionary, the parse of "The fair answers questions" only returns one parse which is consistent with the subject-verb number agreement.
