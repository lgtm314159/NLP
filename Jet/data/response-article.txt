<ngroup>An NYU freshman</ngroup> has confessed to throwing <ngroup>a computer</ngroup> monitor out
of <ngroup>her ninth floor window</ngroup> <ngroup>two weeks</ngroup> ago, narrowly missing <ngroup
>a night</ngroup>
watchman <ngroup>next door</ngroup>.

<ngroup>Jennifer Ottomeyer</ngroup>, <ngroup>a College of Arts and Science freshman</ngroup>, said
<ngroup>she</ngroup> was intoxicated when <ngroup>she</ngroup> threw <ngroup>the monitor</ngroup> out of <ngroup
>her room</ngroup> in
the Rubin <ngroup>Residence Hall</ngroup> at 11:15 pm on February 1.

"<ngroup>We</ngroup> were all very, very drunk," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said.  "<ngroup
>I</ngroup> didn't know there
was <ngroup>a window</ngroup> down below, or that <ngroup>it</ngroup> was possible for <ngroup
>a person</ngroup> to
be anywhere in <ngroup>the vicinity</ngroup>."

<ngroup>The monitor smashed</ngroup> through <ngroup>a basement skylight</ngroup> at 39 Fifth Ave.
<ngroup>The skylight</ngroup> is over <ngroup>the building's employee bathroom</ngroup>.  <ngroup
>A night
watchman</ngroup> was standing just outside <ngroup>the door</ngroup> of <ngroup
>the restroom</ngroup> when
<ngroup>the monitor</ngroup> crashed through <ngroup>the skylight</ngroup>, according to <ngroup
>the
building doorman</ngroup> who wished to remain anonymous.

<ngroup>The doorman</ngroup> noted that <ngroup>the incident</ngroup> could have been serious, had
<ngroup>the night</ngroup> watchman been in <ngroup>the bathroom</ngroup>.

"If <ngroup>he</ngroup> was inside <ngroup>he</ngroup> would have been hurt," <ngroup
>he</ngroup> said.

<ngroup>The toilet</ngroup> and sink in <ngroup>the bathroom</ngroup> were almost directly under
<ngroup>the skylight</ngroup>.

"<ngroup>It</ngroup>'s hard to imagine <ngroup>an action</ngroup> more thoughtless and <ngroup
>sophomoric</ngroup>
than throwing <ngroup>something heavy</ngroup> out <ngroup>the window</ngroup> of <ngroup
>your room</ngroup>,'
University Spokesman <ngroup>John Beckman</ngroup> said.  "<ngroup>I</ngroup> grew up in Manhattan
and <ngroup>I</ngroup> think <ngroup>I</ngroup> was taught not to throw <ngroup>things</ngroup> out <ngroup
>the window</ngroup> by <ngroup>the
time</ngroup> <ngroup>I</ngroup> was two and <ngroup>a half</ngroup>.  <ngroup>It</ngroup>'s egregious, <ngroup
>inexcusable</ngroup>, and
<ngroup>juvenile</ngroup>."

<ngroup>Ottomeyer</ngroup>, <ngroup>a religious studies</ngroup> major, planned to take <ngroup
>a leave of
absence</ngroup> from <ngroup>NYU</ngroup> for <ngroup>academic reasons</ngroup>.  Although <ngroup
>she</ngroup> remains in
<ngroup>her room</ngroup>, University <ngroup>officials</ngroup> have told <ngroup
>her</ngroup> that <ngroup>she</ngroup> would be
banned from <ngroup>NYU housing</ngroup>, <ngroup>Ottomeyer</ngroup> said.

"<ngroup>It</ngroup> would be reasonable to say in general that <ngroup>the tossing of
materials</ngroup> out <ngroup>the window</ngroup>, particularly <ngroup>heavy electronic components</ngroup>,
is <ngroup>a sure path</ngroup> to expulsion from <ngroup>housing</ngroup>,"  <ngroup
>Beckman</ngroup> said.
"Moreover, <ngroup>any damage</ngroup> caused by <ngroup>such an episode</ngroup> would be assessed
to <ngroup>that individual</ngroup>."

After <ngroup>housing officials</ngroup> determined <ngroup>the computer</ngroup> had been thrown
from <ngroup>Ottomeyer's window</ngroup>, <ngroup>they</ngroup> told <ngroup>her</ngroup> that <ngroup
>she</ngroup> could either claim
<ngroup>responsibility</ngroup> for <ngroup>the incident</ngroup> or <ngroup>face police action</ngroup>.  <ngroup
>Ottomeyer</ngroup>
opted to avoid <ngroup>the possibility of police intervention</ngroup> and confessed.

"<ngroup>They</ngroup> were like, 'Hey, fess up or <ngroup>the police</ngroup> will get involved,'"
<ngroup>she</ngroup> said.  "<ngroup>I</ngroup> was taking <ngroup>a leave of absence</ngroup> anyway."

<ngroup>Ottomeyer</ngroup> said <ngroup>she</ngroup> was frustrated with <ngroup
>the computer</ngroup> because "<ngroup>it</ngroup> was
old and <ngroup>it</ngroup> didn't work."

<ngroup>She</ngroup> said <ngroup>she</ngroup> thought throwing <ngroup>the monitor</ngroup> out <ngroup
>the window</ngroup> would be
entertaining.

"<ngroup>I</ngroup> figured <ngroup>no one</ngroup> is ever down there, and <ngroup
>it</ngroup> would be cool to see
<ngroup>a computer monitor</ngroup> hit <ngroup>the ground</ngroup> from <ngroup
>nine floors</ngroup> up," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said.
