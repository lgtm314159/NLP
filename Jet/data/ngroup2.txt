<ngroup>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, <ngroup>the university's third degree-granting portal campus</ngroup>, continues to prepare for <ngroup>its inaugural class</ngroup> entering next semester.
<ngroup>The campus</ngroup> will welcome <ngroup>a class</ngroup> of <ngroup>approximately 300 students</ngroup> in <ngroup>the fall</ngroup>. <ngroup>Assistant Vice President for Admissions</ngroup> <ngroup>Shawn Abbott</ngroup> said <ngroup>51 percent</ngroup> of <ngroup>enrolled students</ngroup> will be <ngroup>citizens</ngroup> of <ngroup>China</ngroup>. <ngroup>This decision</ngroup> was made as <ngroup>a result</ngroup> of <ngroup>NYUSH's partnership</ngroup> with <ngroup>the Ministry of Education</ngroup> in <ngroup>China</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>This expectation</ngroup> is really no different than how <ngroup>many public universities</ngroup> in <ngroup>the United States</ngroup> reserve <ngroup>spaces</ngroup> in <ngroup>their freshman class</ngroup> for <ngroup>in-state residents</ngroup>," <ngroup>he</ngroup> said.
<ngroup>This number</ngroup> is not <ngroup>an indication</ngroup> of <ngroup>easier admission</ngroup> for <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>. <ngroup>Abbott</ngroup> explained that <ngroup>admissions</ngroup> will be selective for <ngroup>all Chinese</ngroup> and <ngroup>international students</ngroup>, as <ngroup>the class size</ngroup> is very small.
<ngroup>The idea</ngroup> of being <ngroup>a foreigner</ngroup> in <ngroup>a strange land</ngroup> appealed to <ngroup>some applicants</ngroup>, like <ngroup>New Jersey high school student Alex Opanasets</ngroup>, who was accepted through <ngroup>early decision</ngroup> and said <ngroup>she</ngroup> was pleased to hear that <ngroup>every international student</ngroup> will room with <ngroup>a Chinese student</ngroup>.
"There can't really be <ngroup>effective exposure</ngroup> to <ngroup>global ideas</ngroup> and <ngroup>perspectives</ngroup> without <ngroup>ample representation</ngroup> from <ngroup>the country</ngroup>," <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup> said.
According to <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup>, <ngroup>the current group</ngroup> of <ngroup>about 15 early decision acceptances</ngroup> are already in <ngroup>contact</ngroup> with <ngroup>each other</ngroup> and include <ngroup>students</ngroup> from <ngroup>10 countries</ngroup> on <ngroup>four continents</ngroup>.

<ngroup>Joanna Waley-Cohen</ngroup>, <ngroup>dean</ngroup> of <ngroup>Arts and Sciences</ngroup> at <ngroup>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, expects <ngroup>the interaction</ngroup> between <ngroup>the groups</ngroup> of <ngroup>students</ngroup> on <ngroup>the portal campus</ngroup> to extend to <ngroup>students</ngroup> studying abroad in <ngroup>Shanghai</ngroup>, as <ngroup>they</ngroup> will likely have <ngroup>overlapping elective courses</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>It</ngroup>'s <ngroup>a wonderful thing</ngroup> for <ngroup>these Chinese freshmen</ngroup> to meet <ngroup>the students</ngroup> from <ngroup>New York</ngroup>," <ngroup>Waley-Cohen</ngroup> said. "<ngroup>These students</ngroup> will learn <ngroup>a lot</ngroup> from <ngroup>each other</ngroup> culturally and within <ngroup>the classroom</ngroup>."
<ngroup>NYUSH faculty</ngroup> will also hail from both <ngroup>China</ngroup> and <ngroup>the United States</ngroup>, underlining <ngroup>NYUSH's value</ngroup> in <ngroup>an integrated global network</ngroup>. <ngroup>Waley-Cohen</ngroup> explained that <ngroup>a cohort</ngroup> of <ngroup>professors</ngroup> from <ngroup>NYUNY</ngroup> will be going to <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> to teach.
<ngroup>The NYUSH class</ngroup> of 2017 will have <ngroup>required courses</ngroup> that emphasize <ngroup>a global perspective</ngroup> by exploring <ngroup>Chinese culture</ngroup>, including <ngroup>social and cultural foundations</ngroup>, <ngroup>writing</ngroup>, <ngroup>language</ngroup>, <ngroup>English</ngroup> for <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup> and <ngroup>Chinese</ngroup> for <ngroup>non-Chinese students</ngroup>. After completing <ngroup>this program</ngroup>, <ngroup>students</ngroup> will have <ngroup>a choice</ngroup> of <ngroup>majors</ngroup> in <ngroup>the humanities</ngroup>, <ngroup>social sciences</ngroup> and <ngroup>STEM fields</ngroup>.
<ngroup>Emily Flippen</ngroup>, <ngroup>a high school student</ngroup> from <ngroup>Texas</ngroup> whose <ngroup>early decision application</ngroup> to <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> was accepted in December, said <ngroup>she</ngroup> was disappointed <ngroup>she</ngroup> could not immediately start <ngroup>classes</ngroup> in <ngroup>her desired major</ngroup> of <ngroup>finance</ngroup> but thinks <ngroup>the core program</ngroup> will ultimately strengthen <ngroup>the university</ngroup>.
"Living alongside <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>, going to <ngroup>the same classes</ngroup> and experiencing <ngroup>the same city</ngroup> offers <ngroup>an invaluable opportunity</ngroup>, one that <ngroup>I</ngroup> could not turn down," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said. "Making <ngroup>strong and challenging courses</ngroup> in <ngroup>these required areas</ngroup> is going to be what allows <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> to grow and attract <ngroup>more students</ngroup> internationally," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said.
