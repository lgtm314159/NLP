<ngroup>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, <ngroup>the university's third degree</ngroup>-granting <ngroup
>portal campus</ngroup>, continues to prepare for <ngroup>its inaugural class</ngroup> entering <ngroup
>next semester</ngroup>.
<ngroup>The campus</ngroup> will welcome <ngroup>a class</ngroup> of approximately <ngroup
>300 students</ngroup> in <ngroup>the fall</ngroup>. Assistant Vice President for Admissions <ngroup
>Shawn Abbott</ngroup> said <ngroup>51 percent of enrolled students</ngroup> will be <ngroup
>citizens of China</ngroup>. <ngroup>This decision</ngroup> was made as <ngroup>a result of NYUSH</ngroup>'s <ngroup
>partnership</ngroup> with <ngroup>the Ministry of Education</ngroup> in <ngroup
>China</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>This expectation</ngroup> is really no different than how <ngroup>many public universities</ngroup> in <ngroup
>the United States reserve spaces</ngroup> in <ngroup>their freshman class</ngroup> for in-<ngroup
>state residents</ngroup>," <ngroup>he</ngroup> said.
<ngroup>This number</ngroup> is not <ngroup>an indication of easier admission</ngroup> for <ngroup
>Chinese students</ngroup>. <ngroup>Abbott</ngroup> explained that <ngroup>admissions</ngroup> will be selective for <ngroup
>all Chinese and international students</ngroup>, as <ngroup>the class size</ngroup> is very small.
<ngroup>The idea</ngroup> of being <ngroup>a foreigner</ngroup> in <ngroup>a strange land</ngroup> appealed to <ngroup
>some applicants</ngroup>, like <ngroup>New Jersey high school student</ngroup> <ngroup
>Alex Opanasets</ngroup>, who was accepted through <ngroup>early decision</ngroup> and said <ngroup
>she</ngroup> was pleased to hear that <ngroup>every international student</ngroup> will room with <ngroup
>a Chinese student</ngroup>.
"There can't really be <ngroup>effective exposure</ngroup> to <ngroup>global ideas and perspectives</ngroup> without <ngroup
>ample representation</ngroup> from <ngroup>the country</ngroup>," <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup> said.
According to <ngroup>Opanasets</ngroup>, <ngroup>the current group</ngroup> of about <ngroup
>15 early decision acceptances</ngroup> are already in <ngroup>contact</ngroup> with each other and include <ngroup
>students</ngroup> from <ngroup>10 countries</ngroup> on <ngroup>four continents</ngroup>.

Joanna <ngroup>Waley-Cohen</ngroup>, <ngroup>dean of Arts and Sciences</ngroup> at <ngroup
>NYU Shanghai</ngroup>, expects <ngroup>the interaction</ngroup> between <ngroup
>the groups of students</ngroup> on <ngroup>the portal campus</ngroup> to extend to <ngroup
>students</ngroup> studying abroad in <ngroup>Shanghai</ngroup>, as <ngroup>they</ngroup> will likely have overlapping <ngroup
>elective courses</ngroup>.
"<ngroup>It</ngroup>'s <ngroup>a wonderful thing</ngroup> for <ngroup>these Chinese freshmen</ngroup> to meet <ngroup
>the students</ngroup> from <ngroup>New York</ngroup>," <ngroup>Waley-Cohen</ngroup> said. "<ngroup
>These students</ngroup> will learn <ngroup>a lot</ngroup> from <ngroup>each other culturally</ngroup> and within <ngroup
>the classroom</ngroup>."
<ngroup>NYUSH faculty</ngroup> will also hail from <ngroup>both China</ngroup> and <ngroup
>the United States</ngroup>, underlining <ngroup>NYUSH's value</ngroup> in <ngroup
>an integrated global network</ngroup>. <ngroup>Waley-Cohen</ngroup> explained that <ngroup
>a cohort of professors</ngroup> from NYUNY will be going to <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> to teach.
<ngroup>The NYUSH class</ngroup> of 2017 will have required <ngroup>courses</ngroup> that emphasize <ngroup
>a global perspective</ngroup> by exploring <ngroup>Chinese culture</ngroup>, including <ngroup
>social and cultural foundations</ngroup>, writing, <ngroup>language</ngroup>, English for <ngroup
>Chinese students</ngroup> and Chinese for <ngroup>non</ngroup>-<ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>. After completing <ngroup
>this program</ngroup>, <ngroup>students</ngroup> will have <ngroup>a choice of majors</ngroup> in <ngroup
>the humanities</ngroup>, <ngroup>social sciences</ngroup> and STEM <ngroup>fields</ngroup>.
<ngroup>Emily Flippen</ngroup>, <ngroup>a high school student</ngroup> from <ngroup
>Texas</ngroup> whose <ngroup>early decision application</ngroup> to <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> was accepted in December, said <ngroup
>she</ngroup> was disappointed <ngroup>she</ngroup> could not immediately start <ngroup
>classes</ngroup> in her desired major of <ngroup>finance</ngroup> but thinks <ngroup
>the core program</ngroup> will ultimately strengthen <ngroup>the university</ngroup>.
"Living alongside <ngroup>Chinese students</ngroup>, going to <ngroup>the same classes</ngroup> and experiencing <ngroup
>the same city</ngroup> offers <ngroup>an invaluable opportunity</ngroup>, one that <ngroup
>I</ngroup> could not turn down," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said. "Making <ngroup>strong and challenging courses</ngroup> in <ngroup
>these required areas</ngroup> is going to be what allows <ngroup>NYUSH</ngroup> to grow and attract <ngroup
>more students</ngroup> internationally," <ngroup>she</ngroup> said.
